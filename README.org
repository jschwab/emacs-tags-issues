* Local TAGS tables in emacs

*UPDATE*: Eli Zaretskii has provided [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-11/msg00560.html][a patch on the emacs-devel list]]
that resolves these issues.  It will be included in emacs 26.

I have been struggling on and off [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2013-02/msg00019.html][for years]] to use local TAGS tables.
Here are recipes to reproduce some of the existing issues with local
tags tables.  These were tested with the current release version of
(emacs 25.1) and the development version (git
c542fab20f53374dd0c71dce949ef370fc76fa48).
